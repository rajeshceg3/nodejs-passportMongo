# Product Requirements Document: Node.js Starter Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Node.js Starter Application. The application is a web-based platform built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS, providing fundamental user authentication features (registration, login, logout) and a basic structure for a web application with protected content. Its primary purpose is to serve as a reusable template and an educational resource for web developers.

## 2. Goals

*   **G1:** To provide a secure, reliable, and functional user registration and login system.
*   **G2:** To offer a clean and understandable boilerplate for web applications requiring user authentication.
*   **G3:** To serve as an educational tool for individuals learning backend web development with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Passport.js.
*   **G4:** To establish a foundation that can be easily extended with additional features and functionalities.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **TA1: Developers:** Individuals or teams looking for a quick start on Node.js projects that require user management.
*   **TA2: Students & Learners:** Individuals learning web development concepts, specifically Node.js backend development, database integration, and authentication mechanisms.

## 4. Functional Requirements

| ID   | Requirement                                                                                                | Priority | Status      |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| FR1  | Users shall be able to register for a new account using a unique username and a password.                  | Must Have| Implemented |
| FR2  | The system shall securely hash user passwords before storing them in the database (using bcrypt).          | Must Have| Implemented |
| FR3  | Users shall be able to log in to the application using their registered username and password.             | Must Have| Implemented |
| FR4  | The system shall maintain user sessions to keep users logged in across multiple requests.                  | Must Have| Implemented |
| FR5  | Users shall be able to log out of the application, which will terminate their current session.             | Must Have| Implemented |
| FR6  | Specific routes (e.g., Home `/`, About `/about`, Gallery `/gallery`, Contact `/contact`) shall be protected. | Must Have| Implemented |
| FR7  | Unauthenticated users attempting to access protected routes shall be redirected to the login page.         | Must Have| Implemented |
| FR8  | Upon successful login, the home page shall display the logged-in user's username.                          | Must Have| Implemented |
| FR9  | The system shall provide clear feedback messages for registration errors (e.g., passwords do not match, username already taken, server-side errors). | Must Have | Partially Implemented (server errors can be improved) |
| FR10 | The system shall provide clear feedback messages for login errors (e.g., incorrect username, incorrect password). | Must Have | Implemented (via connect-flash) |
| FR11 | Usernames should be unique. The system should prevent registration with an existing username.             | Must Have | Implemented |

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID   | Requirement                                                                                                | Priority |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| NFR1 | **Security:** Sensitive configuration data (database URI, session secret) must be managed via environment variables and not hardcoded. | Must Have|
| NFR2 | **Security:** Passwords must be hashed using a strong, industry-standard algorithm (bcrypt).                 | Must Have|
| NFR3 | **Usability:** Login and registration forms should be intuitive and easy to use.                             | Must Have|
| NFR4 | **Usability:** Error messages and user feedback should be clear, concise, and informative.                   | Should Have|
| NFR5 | **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-organized, following a logical structure.                   | Should Have|
| NFR6 | **Maintainability:** Code should include comments where necessary to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions. | Should Have|
| NFR7 | **Performance:** Page load times for basic pages should be reasonably fast under normal conditions.          | Should Have|

## 6. Future Enhancements (Optional)

This section lists potential features and improvements that could be added in the future but are not part of the current scope.

*   **FE1:** Implement password complexity rules (e.g., minimum length, character types).
*   **FE2:** Add a "Forgot Password" / Password recovery mechanism (e.g., via email).
*   **FE3:** Introduce email verification for new user registrations.
*   **FE4:** Create a dedicated user profile page where users can manage their account details.
*   **FE5:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate user permissions (e.g., admin, user).
*   **FE6:** Integrate a more advanced frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) for a richer user interface.
*   **FE7:** Containerize the application using Docker for easier deployment and scaling.
*   **FE8:** Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.
*   **FE9:** Implement API rate limiting.
*   **FE10:** Enhance CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection if not adequately covered by existing middleware.

## 7. Out of Scope

*   Advanced analytics and reporting.
*   Two-factor authentication (2FA).
*   Social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook).
*   Real-time features (e.g., chat).
